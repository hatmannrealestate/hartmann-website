            <h2>Firm</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Hartmann Real Estate is a boutique European real estate development and investment firm dedicated to high‑quality residential and mixed‑use projects in carefully selected markets across Europe. We focus on well‑located but optimized assets and sites, transforming them into architecturally refined, financially resilient properties that create durable value.</p>

            <p>We focus exclusively on real estate and commit our own capital alongside partners in projects where we can directly shape the outcome through design, capex and execution. Our work is grounded in operational fluency and first‑hand experience of how value is generated through the development of real estate, from concept and delivery to long‑term asset performance.</p>

            <p>Every project is treated as both a product and a value‑creation plan: we design buildings for clearly identified demand and credible exit routes, aligning user needs, micro‑location and a robust investment thesis so that architectural quality, liveability and risk‑adjusted performance are built in from the start. Hartmann Real Estate operates as a full value‑chain platform with a track record across planning, development, investment and commercial transactions.</p>

    <!-- BACKGROUND -->

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Bruno Lara has 15+ years of experience across the entire real estate value chain, from planning and development to investment and commercial transactions, with a focus on residential and mixed use assets in the US and Europe. This rare combination of hands on development, value add investing and institutional capital markets work is the foundation of Hartmann Real Estate's full value chain perspective.</p>

            <p>He began his career in commercial architecture, before moving into high end residential development in California, conceiving and delivering bespoke homes for demanding private clients in the Hollywood market. This phase created a deep, practical understanding of how design, construction and client expectations interact on complex luxury projects and how product quality translates into value.</p>

            <p>He then moved into value add residential investment and redevelopment, overseeing acquisitions, capex planning and execution and working closely with private investors, family offices and high net worth individuals to turn underperforming assets into upgraded, higher yielding properties with defined exit strategies.</p>

            <p>He subsequently joined BNP Paribas Real Estate in Germany, where he was promoted to Director International Investment after one year and spent over five years leading international investment mandates. He was responsible for sourcing off‑market opportunities and executing transactions across the entire German market, covering all major asset classes and risk profiles for inbound cross‑border institutional capital.</p>

            <p>His academic background includes a Bachelor of Architecture from Florida Atlantic University in Fort Lauderdale, a Master in Real Estate Development from IE Business School in Madrid, and current candidacy for the Master of Business Administration at London Business School in London and Dubai. This academic track adds a rigorous architectural, financial and strategic foundation to his practical experience and underpins Hartmann Real Estate's disciplined, value‑oriented approach for a broad range of private and institutional investors.</p>

    <!-- APPROACH -->

            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Hartmann Real Estate operates at the intersection of product, execution and capital. We combine an architect's attention to space, proportion, light and detail with a developer's responsibility for cost, timelines and risk, and an investment adviser's discipline around underwriting and exit. This integrated view shapes how we analyse sites, structure business plans and make trade offs between specification, capex and returns. The goal is to deliver projects that are recognisably better to live in, while remaining rigorously grounded in risk adjusted performance.</p>

            <p>Our approach is thesis driven rather than opportunistic. We look for situations where we can clearly articulate how value will be created: through re planning and re positioning existing buildings, through targeted upgrades that materially improve the user experience and operating metrics, or through new developments that fill a specific gap in the local market. We prefer complexity that we understand, planning, design, execution or stakeholder complexity where our capabilities can de risk and simplify the process, over financial engineering for its own sake.</p>

            <p>Across all projects, we aim to build assets that stand up to scrutiny in terms of design, function and performance. That means careful attention to layouts, light, privacy and everyday usability; robust and realistic capex planning; and conservative assumptions on leasing, sales and exits. It also means working constructively with local stakeholders, municipalities, neighbours and partners to ensure that projects contribute positively to their surroundings.</p>
