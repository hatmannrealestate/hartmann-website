        <h2>Background</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Hartmann Real Estate was founded by Bruno Lara to combine a deep commitment to the built environment with a developer's execution experience and an institutional investment perspective. He has 15+ years of experience across the real estate value chain in the US and Europe, from planning and development to investment and commercial transactions, focused on residential and mixed‑use assets.</p>

        <p>Bruno began his career in commercial architecture in Florida before moving into high‑end residential development in California, executing bespoke single‑ and multi‑family projects in locations such as Santa Monica, Pacific Palisades and Malibu. Running projects from concept through completion, he built an execution‑level understanding of how product specification, build quality and end‑user requirements translate into pricing power and risk control in luxury‑grade residential assets.</p>

        <p>He later moved into value‑add residential investment and redevelopment, overseeing acquisitions, capex and execution for private investors, family offices and high‑net‑worth individuals, upgrading underperforming assets into higher‑yielding properties with defined exit strategies. The next step was joining BNP Paribas Real Estate in Germany, where he was promoted to Director International Investment after one year and spent over five years leading international mandates, sourcing off‑market opportunities and executing transactions across all major asset classes and risk profiles for inbound cross‑border institutional capital.</p>

        <p>His academic background includes a Bachelor of Architecture from Florida Atlantic University, a Master in Real Estate Development from IE Business School, and current MBA candidacy at London Business School in London and Dubai. This combination of architectural, development and business training complements his professional experience and informs Hartmann Real Estate's analytical, value‑oriented approach to conceiving and delivering bespoke development projects for private and institutional equity partners, with a focus on generating attractive returns while mitigating risk.</p>
